char are basically ints based on the ASCII table (hexadecimal [address] -> binary number) which is directly manipulated by int
Strings in C are set thru pointers.
	char *p;
	p = "The game is afoot!";
	printf(p);
The pointer points to the first letter's address. String is treated like an array of chars.

Adding one to a string will just delete the first letter and so forth.
*p is also known as "String Literal"
You are not allowed to change String Literals once they are set. 

STRING BUFFERS:
The actual thing holding the string is a buffer (usually much longer than the string can be)
	char buffer[1024];
	strcpy( buffer, "SHORT String" );
	strcat( buffer, " MADE Longer");
	strToLower( buffer );
Notice buffer is itself a variable and not a pointer. buffer can be manipulated. the stuff on the right (the actual strings) cannot be changed once set.
